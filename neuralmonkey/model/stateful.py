"""Module that provides classes that encapsulate model parts with states.

There are three classes: `Stateful`, `TemporalStateful`, and `SpatialStateful`.

Model parts that do not keep states in time but have a single tensor on the
output should be instances of `Stateful`. Model parts that keep their hidden
states in a time-oriented list (e.g. recurrent encoder) should be instances
of `TemporalStateful`. Model parts that keep the states in a 2D matrix (e.g.
image encoders) should be instances of `SpatialStateful`.

There are also classes that inherit from both stateful and temporal or spatial
stateful (e.g. `TemporalStatefulWithOutput`) that can be used for model parts
that satisfy more requirements (e.g. recurrent encoder).
